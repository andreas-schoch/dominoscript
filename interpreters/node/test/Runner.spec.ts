// make sure before and after run are called

// make sure onAfterStep is called after each step

// make sure afterInstruction is called adter each instruction

// test async versions and ensure it delays as expected

// verify that forceInterupt works as expected (e.g. make a script with 20 instructions, set forceInterrupt to 5 and verify that it interrupts every 5th instruction)

// Verify that ALL instructions get properly executed when stepDelay is > 0
